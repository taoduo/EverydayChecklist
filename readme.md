# Everyday Checklist
Make sure certain tasks are completed everyday.

## Motivations
I like to split a big, long term goal into small tasks and split small tasks into everyday efforts.
So when I have several long term tasks, I have a repeated task list everyday over a relatively long
period of time. This application helps me keep track of what needs to be done today.
